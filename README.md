# Java_Gaming_Room
<b>Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?</b>
<p>We are serving as a Technology Consultant for Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) and have been asked to prepare a software design document and begin developing the game application, addressing their software requirements. <br>
CTS has recently taken on a new client, The Gaming Room. The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which is currently available in an Android app only. Draw It or Lose It is loosely similar to the 1980s television game Win, Lose or Draw, where teams compete to guess what is being drawn. Rather than a player drawing images on an easel to help team members guess the puzzle (a phrase, title, or thing), the application will render images from a large library of stock drawings as clues. A game consists of four rounds of play lasting one minute each. Drawings are rendered at a steady rate and are fully complete at the 30-second mark. If the team does not guess the puzzle before time expires, the remaining teams have an opportunity to offer one guess each to solve the puzzle with a 15-second time limit.

<b>What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?</b>
<p>I enjoyed working with the UML diagram It helps to visualize how the program needs to be structured and developed.</p>
<b>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</b>
<p>I will be interested in the future to look back at this and see how my answers would differ on the evaluations and recommendations once I have more experience and exposure working in the field.</p>
<b>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?</b>
<p>Our client had the following restraints:<br>
•	Must be in a web-based format and serve multiple platforms.<br>
•	A game must have the ability to have one or more teams involved.<br>
•	Each team will have multiple players assigned to it.<br>
•	Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name.<br>
•	Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. <br>
The software had to be structured to comply with these contraints. Valuable time and resources can be saved by gathering as much inforamation before developing to address the needs of the software, systems, network and user.

<b>How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?</b>
<p>I find the UML diagram a useful tool that I will implement in the future. It allows you to visualize the structure of the program easily and provides a working map.</p>
